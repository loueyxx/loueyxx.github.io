<h2>Why hire me?</h2>  

<p>I am a creative and ambitious Front-End Web Developer. I have a passion for technology and learning new skills. I have knowledge and experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, bootstrap as well as basic Git knowledge. I studied at sixth form, and around this I had part time retail jobs, and then worked full time as a carer up until 2014. I have had a great interest in Web Development numerous years, and since having my son, I have spent my free time around nursery hours working on my course, and perfecting the skills needed to join a new career.</p>

<p>I enjoy problem solving and I have a logical approach to problems (be it professional or personal) and have a strong desire to join a company that will encourage me to fulfil my full potential and to continue to develop my skills. I have had a gap in employment due to having a baby - who is now about to turn 3! - so I am ready to re-join the world of employment.</p>

<p>As well as enjoying learning, I learn fast (particularly when I enjoy something!), and I have been thrown into the deep end with past jobs. While neither of these were in Web Development, it has shown that I have the aptitude to adapt to a new situation while under pressure, something that did not go unnoticed at work.<p>
