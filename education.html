		<h2>Web Developers Bootcamp</h2>

		<p>In June 2017, I purchased a course on Udemy called The Web Developer Bootcamp. The course has brought me from a complete novice to a capabale Front-End Developer. I am currently half way through this course. I have covered the Front-End side of the course, and the Back-End is what remains to be done. I spent regular evenings and weekends studying the material on here and completing activities set my the Course Instructor. I have found it to be a very informative course, easy to follow as well as interesting and, at times, amusing.(Thank you, Colt!) </p>

		<p>Details of this course can be found <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview"> here</a></p>
		


		<h2>Open University</h2>

		<p>I began a module with the Open University in September 2016, in English Literature. The module was called The Arts, Past and Present. I achieved a pass in this module. I enjoyed this module, and although the initial plan was to continue the full course over the course of 6 years, I realised half way through that I wasn't actually sure I would end up using the degree once I had finished, and was more eager to get into work full time again rather than spending the following 5 years as a student. My interest in Web Development remained for the entirety of this year, with me deciding I would persue a career in this once I had completed this year at University.</p>

		<p>The year at the Open University was very beneficial for me. This is because it engaged my brain again, and helped me re-learn and improve upon my time management skills. I remained a month ahead for the majority of the year, and received good marks and feedbacks from my tutor.</p>
